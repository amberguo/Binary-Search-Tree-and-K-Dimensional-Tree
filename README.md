# Binary-Search-Tree-and-K-Dimensional-Tree

This project has two part
1) BST implemented in C++
2) KNN Classifier and underlying KD tree structure
KD tree is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. 
k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key 
(e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches).
In this project, KNN Classifier check the K nearest neighbors for given big data set.
